To be an independent person, you left home, rented a house, and bought a car. You found a position in a company, which offers you a stable after-tax monthly salary of $5,000. Also, you have $5,000 in your checking and savings accounts combined. Every month, your total payment for constant spending is $2,550, including rent, phone bill, car payment, car insurance renewal, and utilities. Now, you donâ€™t have a college loan and are free of debts. You are free to allocate the surplus of your money.</p>
